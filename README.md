# Hitch-Hike

*Hitch-Hike* is a first-person adventure game where you drive a car along a desert road, picking up travelers along the way & helping them to get where they're headed.

*It's summer break. You bought an old car for a cross-country drive back home. Along the way you'll come across hitch hikers -- some will benefit your journey, others may lead you to all kinds of "Game Over". Good luck, Samaritan.*
